# **Optimizing Online Sports Retail Revenue**

In this SQL project, I analyzed product data for an online sports retail company to optimize revenue. I worked with pricing and revenue, ratings, reviews, descriptions, and website traffic data using techniques such as aggregation, cleaning, labeling, Common Table Expressions, and correlation.

The project involved tasks such as counting missing values, comparing Nike and Adidas pricing, labeling price ranges, evaluating average discounts by brand, analyzing correlation between revenue and reviews, and investigating ratings and reviews by product description length.

I also explored reviews by month and brand, and then separately evaluated the performance of footwear and clothing products. Completing this project showcased my data analysis skills and provided me with valuable experience in working with complex datasets. 

This project was proposed by [Datacamp](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/optimizing_online_revenue), the code and results can be found in the [notebook](https://github.com/felipebita/optimizing_online_sports_retail_revenue/blob/main/notebook.ipynb).
